This component adds support to Popper.JS for any component of Angular that covers

Popper.js is the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to the poppers.

Some of the key points are:

- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!);
- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;
- Supports Shadow DOM elements;
- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;
